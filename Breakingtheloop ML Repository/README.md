The goal of this project is to develop a risk-assessment model to proactively intervene on the most vulnerable individuals by connecting social and mental health workers with individuals in need of care to avoid incarceration, along with its human and economic costs. Specifically, we would like to investigate the individuals most likely to return to prison within twelve months given a specific set of feature values. Of those likely to return, which are best candidates for mental health intervention?
